# Base Camp Learn One-Click Deployer

> Developed by [Kuzey Durden](https://x.com/islakwcterlii/)

This repository packages all of the Solidity exercises from [mztacat/Base](https://github.com/mztacat/Base) into a single Hardhat project so you can compile and deploy every contract in one run. The generated deployment report makes it easy to submit addresses and claim the Base Camp Learn badges referenced in [Berlin💎.ink's thread](https://x.com/isnotberlin/status/1969181622164734028).

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (developed with v24)
- npm 9+
- A funded wallet on Base / Base Sepolia for the actual deployments

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Copy the sample environment file and edit it with your secrets
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Fill in `PRIVATE_KEY`, optional custom RPC URLs, and (if you plan to verify) your Basescan API key. **Never commit your real `.env`.**
3. (Optional) Adjust constructor parameters by copying the sample config
   ```bash
   cp deploy-config.example.json deploy-config.json
   ```
   Edit the values if you need different IDs, names, or salary figures. The deploy script will pick up anything defined in `deploy-config.json`.

## Compile & Dry-Run
```bash
npm run compile           # Compile with all required Solidity versions
npm run deploy:local      # Deploys against the in-memory Hardhat network
```
Running either deploy command creates `deployments/<network>-deployments.json` with contract names, addresses, args, and transaction hashes.

## Deploy to Base networks
- Base Sepolia (recommended for badge submissions)
  ```bash
  npm run deploy:base-sepolia
  ```
- Base mainnet
  ```bash
  npm run deploy:base
  ```
Make sure the wallet behind `PRIVATE_KEY` has enough ETH on the target network to cover gas.

## Claiming the Base Camp Learn badges
The tweet series outlines five on-chain smart-contract modules plus DeFi interactions. After you have deployed using the script:

1. Grab the relevant addresses from `deployments/baseSepolia-deployments.json` (or `base-deployments.json` if you went straight to mainnet).
2. For each Base Camp Learn module (Newcomer → Supreme) open the submission form on [camp.base.org](https://camp.base.org) / [learn.base.org](https://learn.base.org) and paste the contract address that matches the module’s requested exercise. Typical mapping:
   - Arrays / Storage / Structs → **Base Learn Newcomer**
   - ControlStructures / Errors → **Base Learn Acolyte**
   - WeightedVoting / UnburnableToken → **Base Learn Prefect**
   - HaikuNFT / ImportsExercise / AddressBook stack → **Base Learn Supreme**
3. Submit the transaction hashes generated by the script when the form specifically asks for proof. You can click each `txHash` in the JSON output to open the detail page on Basescan.
4. Once every module is approved, visit the linked Guild roles (USDC Saver, cbBTC Maxi, and the Base Learn badge roles) and pass the on-chain checks. Have the following ready:
   - Contract addresses (from the deployments JSON)
   - Evidence of the required DeFi actions (USDC deposit on Base, cbBTC mint/bridge, etc.)
5. Finally, head over to the Base Discord → `#roles` channel, sync your wallet with Guild, and claim the corresponding Discord roles + badge NFTs.

> ⚠️ The exact URLs and required proofs occasionally change. If something has moved, double-check Berlin’s thread and the Base Camp Learn Discord announcements for the latest submission links.

## Useful tips
- Re-run `npm run deploy:base-sepolia` if a transaction fails; Hardhat will deploy new instances and overwrite the JSON report.
- Keep a backup of your deployment file before redeploying, in case you need the original addresses.
- Gas can spike during Base mainnet events. Test on Base Sepolia first, then move to mainnet once you are sure everything verifies.

## Optional UI for wallet-driven deployments
If you would rather deploy and claim each registry PIN straight from a browser wallet, the repo now includes a lightweight React/Vite dapp that reuses the compiled Hardhat artifacts.

1. `cd ui && npm install`
2. `npm run dev` to start the local server (or `npm run build` for a production bundle)

Features:
- RainbowKit + WalletConnect (single “Connect Wallet” modal) with Base Sepolia preset.
- Constructor forms that mirror the defaults in `scripts/deploy-register.js`.
- One-click registry submissions (“Claim PIN”) with the correct gas limits per contract.
- Local progress tracking per wallet + chain (deploy tx, contract address, registry tx).

Because the UI imports JSON from `../artifacts`, re-run `npx hardhat compile` after changing any Solidity file so the frontend picks up the latest ABI/bytecode. For WalletConnect, create `ui/.env` and set `VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=<your_project_id>` to override the bundled demo key.

Happy building and good luck claiming those badges!
